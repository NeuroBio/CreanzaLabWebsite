                What's Going On?
        
                <p>
                    This story, believe it or not, is the very familiar fable of Little Red Riding Hood. 
                    This curious version was written in 1940 by a professor of French named H. L. Chace, 
                    who wanted to show his students that intonation - that is, the melody of a language - 
                    is an integral part of its meaning. The words here are all common English words, but 
                    not the ones you'd expect to tell the story of Little Red Riding Hood.
